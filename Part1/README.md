# Excersise2
1st attempt of excersise

1st Excersise works perfectly.

The only problem is that the computer strikes completely random positions, and not with some kind of strategy.

I also added the ability to play music from a URL of my choice. The URL is necessary so that I don't have to turn in the wav file, as it is not possible to do that because music is a binary, not a text, file.
