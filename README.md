# Excersise2
1st attempt of excersise

1st Excersise works perfectly.

I also added the ability to play music from a wav file. however, this won't be available for a while, as it needs some modifications.




The 2nd Excersise is still under construction.

Also, Paper class has too many constructors to make it as plain as possible to use it without having to remember the sequence of arguments that are necessary for it to work.

However, this cann't be done when I am using a constructor that takes as argument 2 Strings and one int instead of one String, one int and one Conference, as the positions of the Strings, if changed will cause compile time errors.

Anyway, the 1st part is ready.
