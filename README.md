# Excersise2
1st attempt of excersise

1st Excersise works perfectly I think. I don't really know wether the player should be capable of playing the entire game instead of just placing his/her ships. I should send an email to ask...


The 2nd Excersise is still under construction.

I am not quite sure about the Paper class, as it is supposed to initialise the Conference field while it doesn't. I need to ask the proffessor about that too.

Also, Paper class has too many constructors to make it as plain as possible to use it without having to remember the sequence of arguments that are necessary for it to work.

However, this cann't be done when I am using a constructor that takes as argument 2 Strings and one int instead of one String, one int and one Conference, as the positions of the Strings, if changed will cause compile time errors.

Anyway, the 1st part is ready.
